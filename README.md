# Stick GBC Complete

Stick GBC is a gameboy colour re-implementation of XGen Studio's Stick RPG.

## Background

## Building

### Using original repository

    cd games/stickrpg
    make

### Pre-built binaries

Binaries can be found of each version: https://build.dockstudios.co.uk/job/GameboyDev/job/StickGBC

Each build is from the 'main' branch, so pulling the latest should be fine.

To find an individual commit, each commit in the Github repository contains the original commit ID in the description, which is referenced on the build.
